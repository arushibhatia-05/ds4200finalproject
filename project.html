        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>Ski resorts are an extremely popular destination in the U.S and attract millions of visitors. Due to their popularity, there is a wide range of resorts, each that offers different activities and excursions and cost-varying rates per night. Our goal is to analyze different datasets and find a
            correlation between factors that are present in different U.S. ski resorts and how they lead to increased or decreased traffic and tourism at each respective resort. The factors we plan to look into include but are not limited to, geographic location, snowfall levels, terrain difficulty,
            amenities, pricing, and accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>Understanding these dynamics is vital not only for tourists seeking the best ski experience but also for resort operators looking to optimize pricing, improve
            infrastructure, and adapt to changing climate conditions. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, this project will provide insights into how ski resorts can enhance their offerings and how skiers can make informed travel decisions based on the key attributes we
            mentioned above. </p>

        <h2>About our Data</h2>
        <p>The datasets used for this analysis provide a comprehensive comparison of East Coast and West Coast ski resorts in the United States, focusing on snow conditions, slope difficulties, and precipitation patterns. The data was sourced from Github and Kaggle. The data spans multiple CSV files, with a ski resorts file detailing slope difficulty percentages (easy, intermediate, and difficult) across the United States. It included a count of 357 green slopes, 360 blue slopes, and 351 black slopes. The data was then normalized to ensure the percentages sum to 100% for each level of difficulty. Additional datasets, such as precip_state.csv (1,000 rows and 5 columns) and snow_state.csv (1,200 rows and 6 columns), providing regional precipitation and snowfall data, covering the years 2009-2017. Resort-specific snowfall data, including 24 hr New Snow and Season Snowfall Total, was also collected for Jackson Hole, Snowbird, and Telluride, each with around 1,000 rows and 8 columns. The data was cleaned by removing rows with missing values and converting string-based measurements (e.g., “cm”) to numeric values. The last data set we used had 43 columns and 5,470 entries on ski resorts and their different attributes like altitude, location, difficulty levels, restaurants, family activities, etc. The data was cleaned and we pulled 5 main columns regarding the State/Province in which the resort was located, the altitude, and the three levels of difficulty and it was brought down to 4,490 entries. All the steps of collecting the data and scraping  allowed for meaningful comparisons between East and West Coast resorts, providing valuable insights into terrain offerings and snow conditions.
